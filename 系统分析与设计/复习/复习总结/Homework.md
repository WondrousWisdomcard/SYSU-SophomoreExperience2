## Hw05

1.  Software is divided into separately named and addressable components called modules. What is the idea of Modularity in software design? How can we design good software modules?
2. SOLID stands for 5 OOD principles. What are they? What ideas on OOD do they each reveal?
3. There are two kinds of object models in object design in an iterative and evolutionary development with agile method. What are they? What are the differences between the two?

5. Why the object design skill is much more valuable than knowing UML notation?
6. **What are the required knowledge for Fundamental Object Design?**
7. A guideline for dynamic object modeling states that “Spend time doing dynamic modeling with interaction diagrams, not just static object modeling with class diagrams”. What does this statement mean?

9. Explain (or summarize) in your own words on how to do Dynamic Object modeling.
10. Explain (or summarize) in your own words on how to do Static object modeling.

5. What is Use Case Realization? What is the prime input to use case realizations? What are the main tasks we need do during use cage realization?
6. Why should it be based on the GRASP patterns to make the choices and decisions during the design of a use case realization with objects?
7. What artifacts may be the UP implementation model? What artifacts should be used as the inputs for the code generation process?
8. During the mapping design to code, what kinds of translations and what creative work we should do?
